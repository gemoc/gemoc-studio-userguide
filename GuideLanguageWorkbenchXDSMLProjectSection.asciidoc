=== xDSML Project

==== Purpose
The xDSML Project is the core project of languages created using the GEMOC Studio. It has two main purposes:

* Referencing the different projects representing the various parts constituting an xDSML;

* Guiding the ((Language Designer)) in the language creation process through the ((GEMOC Dashboard)) illustrating the workflow of creating an xDSML using the GEMOC Studio.



==== Creating the xDSML Project
In the GEMOC Studio, go to: _File > New > Project... > New GEMOC Language Project_. This will create a new xDSML Project in your workspace.

==== Editing the xDSML Project
The main file constituting the xDSML Project is the _project.xdsml_. To edit this file, open it with the "XDSML Model Editor".

From the information specified in this file, the project generates additional code that is used by the Execution Engine during the execution of models conforming to the xDSML (see <<chapter-gemoc-modeling-workbench>>).
