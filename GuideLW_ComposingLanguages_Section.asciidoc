=== Coordination of Languages with BCOoL
==== What is ((BCOoL))?
((BCOoL)) is a dedicated language to explicitly specify coordination patterns, i.e., to specify, at the language level, how some models conforming to different DSMLs can be coordinated. This enables the integrator to capture the knowledge of integration of systems. In BCOoL, the specification relies on _Operators_. Once an operator is defined between different DSMLs, it can be used to generate a coordination model between any  models conforming the DSMLs used in the operator.

((BCOoL)) is developed on top of the eclipse platform as a set of plugins. More precisely, it is integrated to the GEMOC studio. 
////
The GEMOC studio is the integration of various Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) based technologies adequate for the specification of executable domain specific modeling languages.
////
BCOoL is based on the EMF and its abstract syntax has been developed using Ecore (i.e., the meta-language associated with EMF). The textual concrete syntax has been developed using Xtext, providing advanced editing facilities. 

BCOoL adds coordination facilities to the GEMOC studio. In the language workbench, an _integrator_ can develop BCOoL operators to specify coordination patterns between languages, and then a _system_ designer can use these operators in the modeling workbench to coordinate (possibly heterogeneous) models.
