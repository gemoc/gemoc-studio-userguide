=== Gemoc Language project

In the menu go to: File> New> Projects...> Gemoc Language project

This project will be the aggregator of the other Eclipse projects that will constitute the components of an xDSML.

It mainly defines a project.xdsml file that references these other components.

The xDSML file isn't supposed to be edited manually. The pop up menu on the project (available on right click) or the <<section-process-support-view>> provides a set of wizard to fill this file.   


From these information, the project will generate additional code that will be used by the execution engine when the language will be deployed and used by the <<chapter-gemoc-modeling-workbench>>.
