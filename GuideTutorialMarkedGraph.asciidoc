= Tutorial: Make Marked Graph models executable with the GEMOC Studio

// old title: Animate Marked Graph Models with the GEMOC Studio


== What is expected at the end of this tutorial

This tutorial aims at demonstrating the power of the GEMOC studio to
define an executable semantics and provide graphical animation for a
DSML.   It relies of the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marked_graph[marked graph] language.

The link:images/MarkedGraph/MarkedGraph-wikipedia-anim-all.gif[following animation] shows the expecting results of this tutorial:
according to the fired transitions, tokens move from place to place.

== Install the projects defining the Marked Graph AS and CS

// TODO: It is here that the description of the AS should be given.
// See sirius tutorial.

The domain model is implemented with several EMF projects that you
need to import into your workspace.
A graphical editor defined with Sirius is also available to visualize
and edit Marked Graph models.

////
TODO: If you are using the GEMOC Studio, you can find these projects
from the provided examples (menu File > New > Example... : select
Marked Graph DSML Definition). 
////

=== Import the Marked Graph AS and CS

Download the
link:MarkedGraph/MarkedGraph/MarkedGraph/org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.zip[provided
archive] containing the projects and unzip it.  Then, with the GEMOC
Studio, select __import... / General / Existing Projects into
Workspace__ and import all the projects from the archive file.


=== Abstract Syntax

Marked Graph is a kind of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net[Petri net]
in which every place has exactly one incoming arc and exactly one
outgoing arc.  As a consequence, it a concurrent language (several
transitions may be fired) and has no conflict.

The Domain Model, also called Abstract Syntax or Metamodel, defines :

- A __marked graph__ as a set of __places__ and __transitions__.
- Each __Place__ has exactly one __input__ transition and one __output__
transition and a token count.
- A transition has several __input__ places and several __output__
  places.

// [[MarkedGraph-AS]]

=== Concrete Syntax and Sample Model

The graphical concrete syntax draws places as
circles and transitions as squares.  Inputs and outputs of places and
transitions are designated by arrows.  The following picture shows the
graphical representation of the
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marked_graph[Marked Graph model of wikipedia].

== Set up an xDSML project

In this section, we first create an xDSML project for MarkedGraph
and initialize it with the provided Abstract Syntax (AS) and Concrete
Syntax (CS).

=== Create an xDSML Project

Select an xDSML project (__New > Project > GEMOC
Project / new xDSML Project__).

.Create an xDSML Project
image::images/MarkedGraph/MG-SelectGemocLanguageProject.png[Create an xDSML Project]

The first dialog of the wizard asks for the name of the project. Define
it as __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.xdsml__.


.Define the name of the project
image::images/MarkedGraph/MG-SelectGemocLanguageProject-ProjectName.png[Define the name of the project]

Click on __Next__  and define the name of the language (__markedgraph__).

.Define the name of the language
image::images/MarkedGraph/MG-SelectGemocLanguageProject-LanguageName.png[Define the name of the language] 

=== Open xDSML View 

A file __project.xml__ has been created in the
__org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.xdsml__ project.

.Content of the xDSML Project
image::images/MarkedGraph/MG-XDSML-content.png[Content of the xDSML Project]

When opened, it provides the xDSML view which summarizes all the
important resources used in an xDSML project (which are part of and
managed by other projects).  This view is a kind of control center to
have quick access to the main resources of the project.

== Define the Execution Semantics

// === Execution Semantics Overview

// XXX: à déplacer dans MoCC ou DSE ?

A transition can be fired if there is at least one token in every of
each input place.  When fired, one token is removed from each of its
input places and one token is added to each of its output places.
Several transitions can be fired as the same time.

Defining the execution semantics consists in implementing the previous
behavior.  In the GEMOC approach, it is split in different concerns:

* The definition of Execution Data (ED) like the runtime count of
tokens in a place and Execution Functions (EF) like fire a transition.
ED and EF constitute **the DSA**.

* The definition of the model of concurrency as a set of events and
constraints on these events.  It is **the MoCC** concern that is
defined in a DSE project (using ECL, Event Constraint Language)
possibly completed with MoCCML projects  to define libraries of
constraints.

* The **mapping** between the DSA and the MoCC.

In the current version of the GEMOC studio, the MoCC and the mapping
are tightly coupled and described in ECL (Event Constraint Language).



=== Define DSA

During execution of a MarkedGraph, the number of tokens of a place has
to be recorded and changed according to the fired transitions.  Thus,
we have to manage an execution data (ED) called runtimeTokenCount and
an execution function (EF) on Transition called fire().  Furthermore,
the runtimeTokenCount of each place must be initialized at the start
of the execution. It is the purpose of the EF called initialize() on
the MarkedGraph element.

The DSA of Marked Graph is composed of :

* one ED called  __runtimeTokenCount__
defined on __Place__ . It represents the number of token in a place when the
model is executed.
* one EF called initialize() defined
on __MarkedGraph__. It initializes the runtime token count of each
place with the initial token count.
* one ED called __fire()__ on
__Transition__. It to remove one token from each of its input places
and add one token to all its output places.


==== Extend the AS with ED and EF

At the moment, we need to complete the AS (markedgraph.ecore) with the
ED and EF.  In the next release of the GEMOC Studio this steps will
disappear and extended the AS will be done automatically thanks to
link:http://melange-lang.org/[Melange]

Add the 'runtimeTokenCount' ED on Place, 'fire()' on Transition and
'initialize()' on MarkedGraph.

.Abstract Syntax of MarkedGraph extended with Execution Data (ED) and Execution Functions (EF)
image::images/MarkedGraph/MarkedGraph-AS-DSA.png[Abstract Syntax of MarkedGraph extended with Execution Data (ED) and Execution Functions (EF)]

==== Create the DSA Project

Click on __K3 project__ in the project.xdml editor (Behavioral definition / DSA
definition).  The wizard to create of new Kermeta 3 project is
launched with the name of the project initialized (k3dsa is the last
name). Click "Finish".  The project has been created.

.Create a K3 Project
image::images/MarkedGraph/MG-K3-Create.png[Create a K3 Project]

==== Implement the DSA

Click again on _K3 project_ to open __markedgraph.xtend__.  It
has been initialized with a template that can be discarded and
replaced with the following text.

////
==== Create the Extented Model with Melange

Note: This step should become transparent in a next version of the
GEMOC Stutio.

XXX: What is the status of Melange.  How it works?

////


=== Define DSE

The purpose of the DSE project is to define events (called DSE) on AS
elements that will trigger EF calls when they occurs.  Furthermore,
constraints can be defined on these events to ensure they occur in the
right order.
// XXX: wording must be improved?



==== Create the DSE Project

To create the DSE Project, click on the "ECL Project" in the
__project.xdsml__ editor ("Behavior definition / DSE definition").
// TODO: on the next screen, the Ecore resource must be initialized.
Check that the name is __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.dse__.

.Create a DSE Project
image::images/MarkedGraph/MG-DSE-Create.png[Create a DSE Project]

Click "finish" and the project is created.

Click on "ECL Project" to edit the "markedgraph.ecl" file and replace
its content with the following:

.Template of the ECL file
image::images/MarkedGraph/MG-DSE-Template.png[Template of the ECL file]


==== Define DSE

This step has three main purposes:

* First, it specifies DSE in the context of metaclasses of the AS.
* Then, it links them to EF form DSA --- when a DSE will occurs the
associated EF will be executed.
* Finally, it defines constraints on the DSE to rule the possible
scheduling.  Constraints generally rely on relations which are defined
in the MoCC.

////
TODO: To be added as a next tutorial.
WARNING: Errors are present because the used Relations are not yet
defined...  They will be solved during the next step of this tutorial.
////


NOTE: Please notice that, as often, DSE are defined at the language
level, but at runtime they are instantiated as MSE on each object
instance of the metaclasse they are defined on.  In the same way,
constraints apply to the MSE.

Replace the content of the ECL file with the following code:

////
TODO: Separate the MoCC part.  We could define several relations :
onlyOnce, beforeAll, and delayedPrecede.

TODO: Say that the Precede relation is defined in kernel.ccslLib or
CCSL.ccslLib.
////


TODO: Give some rationals on the relation and their instancitions. In
particular the delay.

What should be explained?

- The main principles (we can fire as much transition has the initial
token count of a place, thus a delayed is introduce)
- We want to ensure that one init is done before any fire (and only
once)

TODO:
Provide a pointer to a MoCCML version which uses constraint automata
to define the MoCC.

expression.

////



=== Define Animation Viewpoint


During the execution of a Marked Graph model, we want to visualize :

* the number of tokens in any place: the runtime token count will be printed in the circle of one place.
* the firable transitions: they will be drawn in green.

// and the size of the circle can be proportional to the number of tokens it
// contains.

As the animation view is close to the graphical concrete syntax, we
extend the existing diagram description.

First, we will define a graphical representation based on the graphical
Marked Graph syntax to the wizard called "Create GEMOC debug
representation", then we will add a layer to describe the graphical
animation of a Marked Graph model.

==== Create a debug representation (as an extension of the graphical editor viewpoint)

===== Run the wizard

Do __New > Other / Create GEMOC debug representation__ to run the wizard.

.Create GEMOC debug representation wizard
image::images/MarkedGraph/XXX.png[Create GEMOC debug representation wizard]

On the first screen of the wizad, select "Extends an existing diagram
description".

.Select "Extends an existing diagram description"
image::images/MarkedGraph/XXX.png[Select "Extends an existing diagram description"]


Select the viewpoint to extend "MarkedGraph diagram".

.Select the viewpoint to extend
image::images/MarkedGraph/XXX.png[Select the viewpoint to extend]

Finally, we can fill in the Project Name in which the newly creating
viewpoint file will take place (org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation),
the name of the viewpoint file (markedgraph-animation.odesign), the
viewpoint name (MarkedGraphViewpoint) and the diagram name (MarkedGraph).

.Information of the animation viewpoint
image::images/MarkedGraph/XXX.png[Information of the animation viewpoint]

The last screen allows to choose the name of the layer to be created. Debug
is a good name.

Once the __Finish__ button is pressed, the project is created.

===== Open the markedgraph-animation.odesign

Open the markedgraph-animation.odesign file and develop its content.

TODO: explain its contents.


===== Load markedgraph.odesign as a resource.

// TODO: shold be fixed?

To be able to complete the definition of the odesign file, we first need to
load the existing markedgraph.odesign as a resource :

* Right click in the markedgraph.odesign editor to select __Load Resource...__.
* Select __Browse workspace...__
* Select __markedgraph.odesign__ in the
__org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.design__ project
* Click OK
* Click OK


===== Add markedgraph.ecore to the metamodels

* Select "Diagram Extension MarkedGraph" element.
* In the properties view, select __metamodels__.
* Click on "Add from workspace".
* Select "markedgraph.ecore" (unfold the project structure)
* Click OK


===== Complete the debug representation

On the "Mapping Based Decoration Enabled breakpoint" and "Mapping Based
Decoration Disabled breakpoint", select the "Place" and "Transition"
element.

The debug view will show a symbol on the Place and Transition to show
whether the corresponding breakpoint is enabled or disabled.


===== Complete the dependencies of the project

// TODO: To be fixed.

* Open the plugin.xml file of the project.
* Select the __dependencies__ tab.
* Click "Add..." in the "Required Plug-ins" area.
* Select "org.gemoc.gemoc_language_workbench.extensions.sirius"
* Click OK
* Save the plugin.xml resource.

===== Set the animation viewpoint in project.xml

In the xDSML editor, we can select the animation viewpoint by selecting the
newly created project (__org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation__)


==== Create an animation representation

After the debug presentation has been defined, we can complete it to add an
animation layer.

===== Create the Animation Layer

* Right click on "Diagram extension MarkedGraph" to __select New Diagram
  Element / Additional Layer__.
* Set its "id" to "Animation".


===== Display the firable transition with a green background color

* Right click on "Animation" to select "New Customization / Style
Customizations".
* Right click on "Style Customizations" to select "New Customization /
Style Customization".
* On "Style Customization", set the "Predicate Expression" to
"[self.eGet('inputs')->forAll(p | p.eGet('runtimeTokenCount').toString().toInteger() > 0) /]"
* Right click on "Style Customization" to select "New Customization /
Property Customization (by selection)"
* For "Applied On" property, select "Square white".
* For "Property Name", set "color" (completion is available with CTRL-SPACE)
* For "Value Selction", set "light_green"

===== Set the background color of a place to light_yellow

Perform the same action as above to set the background color of place to
yellow.

// FIXEM : how to select thr right (ellipse white)?

===== Display the runtime token count in a place


* Right click on "Style Customization" to select "New Customization /
Property Customization (by expression)"
* For "Applied On" property, select "Ellipse white".
* For "Property Name", set "labelExpression" (completion is available with CTRL-SPACE)
* For "Value Selction", set "feature:runtimeTokenCount"


====== Add the Animation service !

* Right click on "MarkedGraphViewpoint" to select "New Extension / Java
Extension".
* Set "Qualified Class Name" to
"org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation.services.MarkedgraphAnimationServices".

In the project, __org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation__ project, in
src/org.gemoc.sample.markedgraph.animation.services, copy the
MarkedgraphDebugServices.java class to
MarkedgraphAnimationServices.java.  Then, change
AbstractGemocDebuggerServices to AbstractGemocAnimatorServices in its
source code (two times: import and extends).  Finally, change "Debug" to
"Animation".

//T ODO: The aird has to be provided!

// XXX: Add a link to a tutorial for Sirius Animator.


== Animate a Model
