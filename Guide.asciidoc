== Introduction

The GEMOC Studio offers 2 main usages:

* Building and composing new executable DSML. This mode is intended to be used by language designers (aka domain experts).

* Creating and executing models conformant to executable DSMLs. This mode is intended to be used by domain designers.

Each of these usage has it own set of tools that are referenced as *Gemoc Language workbench* for the tools for _language designers_ and *Gemoc Modeling Workbench* for the tools for _domain designers_.

The GEMOC Language Workbench allows building and composing new executable DSMLs.



To acheive that, it offers appropriate tools and guidance for the underlying activities wich are grouped in categories.


.Build executable language
The first main activity is to build an executable language. The language designer is assited by a dedicated Dashboard to guide him during his work.

This first dashboard groups the activities as follow:

Create a language::
    This activity can be decomposed in activities in two groups :
        Domain model (abstract syntax):::
            * Create the abstract syntax with EMF (incl., the ecore model and the genmodel)
        Model editors (concrete syntax):::
            * Create a graphical editor with Sirius Designer
            * Create a textual editor with Xtext
Make your language executable::
    This activity is decomposed in 2 main parts:
        Sequential Execution semantics:::
            * Create the execution semantics with Kermeta and Melange
        Concurrent Execution semantics:::
            * Create the Domain-Specific Actions with Kermeta and Melange
            * Create the Domain-Specific Events with ECL
            * Create a library of Model of Computation with MoccML
Define the runtime environnement fot the language::
        Model Debugger:::
            * Select your breakpointable elements
        Model dynamic representation (for debugging, animation, monitoring):::
            * Create the graphical representation with Sirius Animator
            * Plug your own add-ons

.Compose executable languages
The second main activity is to define the composition between executable languages.
The language integrator is also assisted by a dedicated dashboard that proposes the following activity groups:

=== General concerns and prerequisite

[NOTE]
In order to run, Eclipse workbench work better with additional memory. Use the following setting to start Eclipse: -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
