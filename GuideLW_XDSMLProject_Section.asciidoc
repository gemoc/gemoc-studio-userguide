=== xDSML Project

==== Purpose
The xDSML Project is the core project of languages created using the GEMOC Studio. It has two main purposes:

* Referencing the different projects implementing the various parts constituting an xDSML;

* Guiding the ((Language Designer)) in the language creation process through the ((GEMOC Dashboard)) illustrating the workflow of creating an xDSML using the GEMOC Studio.



==== Creating the xDSML Project
In the GEMOC Studio, go to: _File > New > Project... > New GEMOC Language Project_. This will create a new xDSML Project in your workspace.

==== Editing the xDSML Project
The main file constituting the xDSML Project is the _project.xdsml_. To edit this file, open it with the _XDSML Model Editor_.

From the information contained in this file, the project generates additional code that is used by the Execution Engine during the execution of models conforming to the xDSML (see <<chapter-gemoc-modeling-workbench>>).
